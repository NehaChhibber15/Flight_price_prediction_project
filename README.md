# Flight_price_prediction_project
Anyone who has booked a flight ticket knows how unexpectedly the prices vary. The cheapest available ticket on a given flight gets more and less expensive over time. This usually happens as an attempt to maximize revenue based on - 1. Time of purchase patterns (making sure last-minute purchases are expensive) 2. Keeping the flight as full as they want it (raising prices on a flight which is filling up in order to reduce sales and hold back inventory for those expensive last-minute expensive purchases) So, we have to work on a project where we collect data of flight fares with other features and work to make a model to predict fares of flights.
